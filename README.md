# Building a decentralized password manager with Ethereum and IPFS
During this workshop, we will go through what it takes to make a fully functioning DApp from start to finish. Firstly we set up metamask for authentication/authorization and connect to it with Web3.js. Then we connect the front-end with IPFS and the Kovan testnet. Finally, we upload our encrypted passwords to IPFS and store the resulting hash on the Blockchain. Bonus: we will show how to host our DApp on IPFS, so we have a fully decentralized stack.
